# stenotool
steno tool for hiding things in imagees
it has simplle gui with buttons
choose the image where you want to hide something and then choose text file with text that will be inside the picture
last step is to choose the folder where new picture with surprise goes
plan for future is to use openai api to make gui cooler and add functionality of easy script(text to script thing)
