Steno tool for hiding things in images.
It has simple gui with buttons.
1.Choose the image where you want to hide something.
2.Choose text file with text that will be inside the picture.
3.Last step is to choose the folder where new picture with surprise goes:)
plan for future is to use openai api to make gui cooler and add functionality of easy script(text to script thing)
